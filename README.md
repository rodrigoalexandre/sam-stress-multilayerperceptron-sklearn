Project developed for the study presented in the article “Using Machine Learning to analyze stress levels in electroencephalogram data”. 
<br><br>
This study consists of evaluating Machine Learning models for classifying stress levels using electroencephalogram data. The models evaluated were Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, eXtremme Gradient Boosting and Multilayer Perceptron. The models were trained on data from SAM 40 dataset. This dataset has records of brain activity of 40 individuals who were monitored while performing certain stress-inducing activities. The Multilayer Perceptron was the model that presented the best performance, reaching an accuracy rate of 98.99% in the predictions.
<br><br>
The libraries used in the project were: scikit-learn, Pandas, XGBoost, Imbalanced-learn, Matplotlib, scipy, Seaborn, Tensorflow and Keras.
